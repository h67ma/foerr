# Remains source code
This project does not directly reuse any code from *FoE: Remains*. However, the overall concept is closely based on it.

# Remains resources
Original resources (such as images, animations, level design, story, translations, sound effects, etc.) for
*FoE: Remains* were created by their respective authors, including: Empalu, Dip Fanken, Voidstar, Mihasik, Apple_Snack,
GreyGazer, Shadow_Of_History, SiMonk0, GriffinPie, Aleck233, EmeraldGalaxy, EBK21, Ziemniakford aka Goblin, Kraples,
Esperant, Stealthief Loot, Wingy, Katzenreh, TRAUMÃ†, and possibly others.
See the [original project page](http://foe.ucoz.org/contact_en.html) for details.

These assets (except music, which was distributed under CC BY-NC 4.0) have not been released under any specific license,
however the main project author, Empalu, has stated that all derivative projects should be distributed free of charge
(excluding donations)
[[1]](https://discord.com/channels/464475588279664640/464497019939979264/861844318137745428).

To satisfy this requirement, resources (except fonts) are distributed under a different license than rest of the
project: CC BY-NC-SA 4.0. The remaining part of the project can be thought of as a very limited game engine, while
the resources are what make it resemble the original game.

Resources (except fonts) are located in the `res` directory, which also includes the license file.

Many of these original resources have been modified and new ones have been created.
